# You can specify the storage type Mackup will use to store your configuration
# files.
# For now you have 3 options: "dropbox", "google_drive" and "file_system".
# If none is specified, Mackup will try to use the default: "dropbox".
# With the "dropbox" storage engine, Mackup will automatically figure out your
# Dropbox folder.
